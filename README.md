# Computer Vision Techniques & Practice

This repository contains different techniques used in Computer Vision from classical techniques to deep learning based approaches. The contents start with simple concepts & examples and use Open CV. In the later sections deep learning based approaches are tried where Scene Understanding to Object Detection have been implemented for practice.

Solutions uses multiple techniques across frameworks like PyTorch,Tensorflow & Keras.
